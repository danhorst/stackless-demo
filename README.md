# Project: Stackless Demo

This is the GitHub repository for the project you named "stackless-demo", generated from the "yaxt-demo" website template at [yax.com](https://yax.com).

From here, deploy your website for free hosting. Just click a button to deploy your website to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Render.com](https://render.com/). During the process, you will create a second repo for deployment. Name it what you like; I suggest "stackless-demo-deploy".

## Stackless newsletter

It is early days for Yax. If you are curious about what we are doing, go to [stackless.community](https://stackless.community/) and sign up for the newsletter, all about Yax and building websites without frameworks or build tools.



# Yax Template Demo

This is the first template designed for the [yax.com](https://yax.com/) website builder project.

The template includes the [Mavo](https://mavo.io/) website editor so you can edit content on the website.
